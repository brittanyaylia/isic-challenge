# ISIC Machine Learning: Identifying Melanoma 

An analysis of the existing data from the [ISIC 2016 Challenge Dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data#2019) was done, which consisted of images of common pigmented skin lesions. A model then was built to classify and identify melanoma from the skin lesion images.
